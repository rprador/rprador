# Sturm-Liouville Equations

When applying separation of variables to second-order linear PDEs, very often we come across differential equations that reduce to eigenvalue problems. Such eigenvalue problems look something like this:

$$ \frac{d^2 \phi}{dx^2} + \lambda \phi(x) = 0 \,, $$

where $\phi=\phi(x)$ comes from separation of variables and $\lambda$ is a constant from separation of variables. Of course, there are boundary conditions given along side this.
