# Second-Order ODEs

Here, we look at differential equations of the form

$$ \begin{equation} y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x) \,. \end{equation} $$

Many problems in physics and engineering involve these types of ODEs.

## Homogenous Linear Second-Order ODEs With Constant Coefficients

Consider the following ODE:

$$ \begin{equation} ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \end{equation} \,, $$

where $a,b,c$ are constants.
