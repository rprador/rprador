title: First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations

Given an ordinary (only total derivatives) differential equation, the **order** of the differential equation is given by the order of the highest derivative. For example,

$$ \begin{align*} y' + 2y &= 1 \quad (\text{First-order}) \\
y' + y^2 &= 2 \quad (\text{First-order}) \\
m\frac{d^2 r}{dx^2} &= F \quad (\text{Second-order}) \\
\left( \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \right)^4 \frac{du}{dx} &= 0 \quad (\text{Second-order}) \\ \end{align*}$$

Note to be careful with confusing powers for order. The last example above is still second-order as its derivative is of order 2 -- the power of 4 does not count!
