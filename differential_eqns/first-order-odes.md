title: First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations

Given an ordinary (only total derivatives) differential equation, the **order** of the differential equation is given by the order of the highest derivative. For example,

$$ y' + 2y = 1 (\text{First-order}) $$

$$ y' + y^2 = 2 (\text{First-order}) $$

$$ m\frac{d^2 r}{dx^2} = F (\text{Second-order}) $$

$$ \left( \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \right)^4 \frac{du}{dx} = 0 (\text{Second-order}) $$

Note to be careful with confusing powers for order. The last example above is still second-order as its derivative is of order 2 -- the power of 4 does not count!
