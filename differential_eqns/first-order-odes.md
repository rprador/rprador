Given an ordinary (only total derivatives) differential equation, the **order** of the differential equation is given by the order of the highest derivative. For example,

$ y' + 2y = 1 (\text{First-order}) $

$ y' + y^2 = 2 (\text{First-order}) $

$ m\frac{d^2 r}{dx^2} = F (\text{Second-order}) $

$ \left( \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} \right)^2 \frac{du}{dx} = 0 (\text{Second-order}) $
