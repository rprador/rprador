# Separation of Variables

Separation of variables is one of the most useful methods to try at first when solving poth PDes and ODes. The basic idea is to split the solution into functions of a single variable, like so

$$ u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) ,. $$

For the linear PDes solved with this method, we can employ two addition theorems:

$$ \begin{theorem} Given a linear, homogenous PDE, if $u_j$ (where $j=1,\dots, n$) are solutions to the same linear PDE. \end{theorem} $$
