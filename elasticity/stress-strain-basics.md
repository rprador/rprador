# Stress and Strain Basics

Short reference page dedicated to definitions and notation (I frequently forget them).

For a given force $F$ acting over a cross-sectional area $A$ of a prismatic bar, the average **stress** is defined as the ratio

$$ \mathbf{\sigma} = \lim_{\delta A\rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta F}{\delta A} \approx \frac{\mathbf{F}}{A} $$
