# Stress and Strain Basics

Short reference page dedicated to definitions and notation (I frequently forget them).

For a given force $F$ acting over a cross-sectional area $A$ of a prismatic bar, the average **stress** is defined as the ratio

$$ \begin{equation} \mathbf{\sigma} = \lim_{\delta A\rightarrow 0} \frac{\delta F}{\delta A} \approx \frac{\mathbf{F}}{A} \end{equation} $$

Since the stress depends on an applied force to the body, it is a vector quantity. The stress components that are perpendicular to the area $A$ are called **normal stresses** and the stress components acting in the plane of $A$ are called **shearing stresses**. The following notation is frequently used:

$$ \begin{align*}  \sigm_{x} & \sigma_y & \sigma_z & \text{(Normal Stresses)} \\ \tau_{xy}=\tau{yx} & \tau_{zx}=\tau{xz} & \tau_{zy}=\tau{yz} & \text{(Shear Stresses)} \end{align*} $$
