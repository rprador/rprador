# Reynold's Transport Theorem
Studying fluids typically involve looking at specific "sections" of the fluid known as *control volumes*. This is not the only way to study a fluid but it is the most commonly introduced method.

The above figure shows such a control volume for a fluid flowing through an arbitrary surface (a). The differential volume through a differential element $$dA$$ traces out a slanted parallelepiped (b) that is along the direction of the velocity $$\textbf{V}$$ (b).
