# Derivation of the Equivalent One-Body Problem

![Coordinates](mechanics/figures/CM_coords.PNG)

Suppose we have two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, with the only forces present being an interaction potential $U$. We also assume that the interaction potential depends either on the positions of the masses relative to one another ($r\_2 - r\_1$) or on their relative velocities $\dot{r}\ _2 - \dot{r}\_2$. Note that these are ***relative*** quantities.
