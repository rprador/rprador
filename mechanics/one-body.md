# Derivation of the Equivalent One-Body Problem

![Coordinates](https://rprador.github.io/rprador/mechanics/figures/CM_coords.PNG)

Suppose we have two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, with the only forces present being an interaction potential $U$. We also assume that the interaction potential depends either on the positions of the masses relative to one another ($\textbf{r}\_2 - \textbf{r}\_1$) or on their relative derivatives $\dot{\textbf{r}}\_2 - \dot{\textbf{r}}\_2$, which we allow to be of any higher order. Note that these are ***relative*** quantities. What we do now is encode the six degrees of degrees (three per mass) into two vectors: the radius vector of the center-of-mass (CM) $\textbf{R}$ and the position vector from one mass to the other $\textbf{r}=\textbf{r}\_2 - \textbf{r}\_2$.
